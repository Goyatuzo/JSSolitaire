				<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Gingers (PETGingers) is the largest Ginger rights organization in the world, with more than twelve members and supporters worldwide.</p>
				<br>
				<p>PETGingers focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of Gingers suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in the clothing trade, in laboratories, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other projects, including Gingineers without Borders as well as ending cruelty to domesticated Gingers. </p>
				<br>
				<p>PETGingers works through public education, cruelty investigations, research, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns.</p>
